How to Install VMware Workstation on Chromebook

1. Download the latest version of GCC
https://mirrors.concertpass.com/gcc/releases/gcc-12.2.0/

1a. Download VMware Workstation (This software requires a license to run, but you can use the trial)
https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/downloads/details?downloadGroup=WKST-1701-LX&productId=1376&rPId=100684

2. Copy the tarball to the Linux Folder

3. Prep the Container
sudo apt-get install lib-dev build-essential dkms -y

3a. If you need to use a SmartCard. Install these packages to enable:
sudo apt-get install libpcsclite1 pcscd
sudo systemctl start pcscd
systemctl status pcscd

4. Next we are going to install the latest version of GCC that will be compatible with VMware Workstation 17
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
tar -xvf gcc-12.2.0.tar.gz
cd gcc-*
./contrib/download_prerequisites

5. Check the number of CPU's for your machine by running this command. This is necessary to build the gcc package from source:
grep -w processor /proc/cpuinfo|wc -l

6. Run the configure with sudo
sudo ./configure --enable-languages=c,c++ --disable-multilib --with-system-zlib --prefix=/usr/local/linux_gcc12.2.0

7. Run the make command the number after -j is the number of CPU's on your machine that you got from cpuinfo (it will take about 30-45 minutes to run depending on how much RAM/Memory you allocated to the container. Grab some Chai, Cheesesteak, Nama Choma o a Coffee):
make -j8 

8. Next install the make build
sudo make install
